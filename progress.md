# Paper Airplane FPV Game - Development Progress

## Project Overview
Created an immersive iOS game using SpriteKit that simulates flying a paper airplane from a first-person view (FPV) perspective.

## Completed Work

### Core Game Architecture
- **GameScene.swift**: Complete rewrite of the game scene with FPV camera system
- **GameViewController.swift**: Updated to create scene programmatically instead of loading from .sks file
- **Physics System**: Implemented collision detection with proper category bitmasks

### Game Features Implemented

#### FPV Camera System
- Dynamic camera following behind the airplane
- Speed-based camera positioning and responsiveness
- Camera shake effect at high speeds
- Smooth interpolation for natural movement

#### Paper Airplane
- Custom shape-based airplane design using SKShapeNode
- Realistic physics with acceleration, drag, and velocity limits
- Rotation based on movement direction
- Touch-controlled movement system

#### Visual Environment
- **Parallax Background**: Multi-layered sky with gradient colors
- **Cloud System**: Decorative clouds in midground layer
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: Three types (clouds, animated birds, buildings)
- **Star Collectibles**: Rotating golden stars with glow effects

#### Game Mechanics
- **Wind System**: Random wind forces affecting airplane movement
- **Scoring System**: Points for survival time and star collection
- **Collision Detection**: Proper handling of obstacles and collectibles
- **Game Over**: Restart functionality with score display

#### UI Elements
- Score display with real-time updates
- Speed indicator with color-coded feedback
- Game instructions
- Game over screen with final score

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Physics Categories
- Airplane: 0x1 << 0
- Obstacles: 0x1 << 1  
- Collectibles: 0x1 << 2
- Ground: 0x1 << 3

#### Parallax Layers
- Background layer (sky gradient)
- Midground layer (clouds)
- Foreground layer (game objects)

#### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient object cleanup for off-screen elements
- Optimized collision detection
- Memory management for particle effects

## Files Modified/Created

1. **Paper/GameScene.swift** - Complete game implementation
2. **Paper/GameViewController.swift** - Updated scene initialization
3. **README.md** - Game documentation and instructions
4. **progress.md** - This development progress document

## Game Controls
- **Touch & Drag**: Control airplane direction and speed
- **Tap after game over**: Restart the game

## Current Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Game is fully functional and ready for testing

The FPV paper airplane game is now complete with all core features implemented, providing an immersive flying experience with realistic physics, dynamic obstacles, and smooth FPV camera movement.
