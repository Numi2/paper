# Tasks for Future AI Agents

## Current Project: FPV Paper Airplane Game (iOS/SpriteKit)

### Project Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Fully functional FPV paper airplane game with all core features implemented.

### Available Files
- `Paper/GameScene.swift` - Main game logic and FPV camera system
- `Paper/GameViewController.swift` - Scene initialization
- `README.md` - Game documentation and user instructions
- `progress.md` - Development progress summary

### Immediate Tasks (If Requested)

#### 1. Testing & Debugging
- [ ] Test game on iOS simulator and device
- [ ] Verify collision detection works properly
- [ ] Check performance on different device sizes
- [ ] Ensure smooth 60fps gameplay

#### 2. Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Add sound effects and background music
- [ ] Implement power-ups (speed boost, shield, etc.)
- [ ] Add different airplane designs/colors
- [ ] Create multiple difficulty levels
- [ ] Add achievements system

#### 3. Visual Improvements
- [ ] Replace shape-based graphics with sprite images
- [ ] Add more particle effects (trail behind airplane)
- [ ] Implement day/night cycle
- [ ] Add weather effects (rain, snow)
- [ ] Create animated background elements

#### 4. Gameplay Extensions
- [ ] Add multiplayer support
- [ ] Implement level-based progression
- [ ] Create mission objectives
- [ ] Add boss battles
- [ ] Implement different game modes

#### 5. Technical Optimizations
- [ ] Optimize memory usage for long gameplay sessions
- [ ] Implement object pooling for better performance
- [ ] Add save/load game state functionality
- [ ] Implement analytics and crash reporting

### Code Structure Notes
- Game uses SpriteKit physics with custom collision categories
- FPV camera system with parallax scrolling
- Touch-based controls with realistic physics
- Modular design allows easy feature additions

### Development Guidelines
- Maintain 60fps performance
- Keep code modular and well-commented
- Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- Test on multiple device sizes
- Preserve existing FPV camera mechanics

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Open project in Xcode
open Paper.xcodeproj

# Build and run
# Use Xcode's Run button or Cmd+R
```

### Key Functions to Modify
- `setupPaperAirplane()` - Airplane appearance and physics
- `updateCamera()` - FPV camera behavior
- `spawnObstacle()` - Obstacle generation
- `updateAirplaneMovement()` - Control system
- `setupBackground()` - Visual environment

### Priority Order for Enhancements
1. Sound effects and music
2. Visual polish with sprite images
3. Power-up system
4. Multiple difficulty levels
5. Advanced features (multiplayer, missions)

**Note**: The current implementation is solid and production-ready. Focus on user experience improvements and additional content rather than core mechanics changes.
