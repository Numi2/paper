# Tasks for Future AI Agents

## Current Project: FPV Paper Airplane Game (iOS/SpriteKit)

### Project Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Fully functional FPV paper airplane game with all core features implemented.

### Available Files
- `Paper/GameScene.swift` - Main game logic and FPV camera system
- `Paper/GameViewController.swift` - Scene initialization
- `README.md` - Game documentation and user instructions
- `progress.md` - Development progress summary
Requestedsual Improvements

#### 4. Gameplay Extensions
- [ ] Add multiplayer support


### Code Structure Notes
- Game uses SpriteKit physics with custom collision categories
- FPV camera system with parallax scrolling
- Touch-based controls with realistic physics
- Modular design allows easy feature additions

### Development Guidelines
- Maintain 60fps performance
- Keep code modular and well-commented
- Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- Test on multiple device sizes
- Preserve existing FPV camera mechanics

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Open project in Xcode
open Paper.xcodeproj

# Build and run
# Use Xcode's Run button or Cmd+R
```

### Key Functions to Modify
- `setupPaperAirplane()` - Airplane appearance and physics
- `updateCamera()` - FPV camera behavior
- `spawnObstacle()` - Obstacle generation
- `updateAirplaneMovement()` - Control system
- `setupBackground()` - Visual environment

### Priority Order for Enhancements
1. Sound effects and music
2. Visual polish with sprite images
3. Power-up system
4. Multiple difficulty levels
5. Advanced features (multiplayer, missions)

**Note**: The current implementation is solid and production-ready. Focus on user experience improvements and additional content rather than core mechanics changes.
